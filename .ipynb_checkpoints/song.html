        <p>For all the times that you rained on my parade
            And all the clubs you get in using my name
            You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
            You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
            And I didn't wanna write a song
            'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
            I don't, but you still hit my phone up
            And baby, I'll be movin' on
            And I think you should be somethin'
            I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
            My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            And I never like to admit that I was wrong
            And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
            But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
            'Cause if you like the way you look that much
            Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
            And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
            You should go and love yourself
            But when you told me that you hated my friends
            The only problem was with you and not them
            And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
            And tried to make me forget where I came from
            And I didn't wanna write a song
            'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
            I don't, but you still hit my phone up
            And baby, I'll be movin' on
            And I think you should be somethin'
            I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
            My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            And I never like to admit that I was wrong
            And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
            But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
            'Cause if you like the way you look that much
            Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
            And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
            You should go and love yourself
            For all the times that you made me feel small
            I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
            I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
            Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
            'Cause if you like the way you look that much
            Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
            And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
            You should go and love yourself
            'Cause if you like the way you look that much
            Oh baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah)
            And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm)
            Still holdin' on to somethin' (holdin' on, no)
            You should go and love yourself</p>
